# Weight Tracker App Readme

## Requirements and Goals
The Weight Tracker app was developed to address user needs for a convenient and simplistic tool to monitor weight and track progress toward their weight loss or gain goals. The app aims to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their daily weights, set a goal weight, and receive notifications upon reaching their goal.

## Screens and Features
To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, the Weight Tracker app consists of the following screens and features:
1. **Login/Registration**: Users can create an account or log in to access their personalized weight-tracking data.
2. **Weight Entry**: Users can input their daily weight measurements along with the date.
3. **Goal Setting**: Users can set a target weight goal and track their progress towards achieving it.
4. **Data Display**: Users can view their weight history in a table, allowing them to visualize their progress over time.
5. **Notifications**: Users receive notifications when they reach their goal weight, providing them with a sense of achievement and motivation.

The UI designs prioritize simplicity and ease of use. Clear and simplistic navigation enables users to access different screens effortlessly. User feedback and suggestions were incorporated during the design process to ensure the app meets their expectations and provides a good experience.

## Coding Approach
The app was coded using industry-standard practices and techniques. Object-oriented programming principles were applied to create reusable and modular code. Additionally, libraries and frameworks specific to Android development, such as Android Jetpack components, were utilized to enhance functionality and streamline development.

Regular testing was integral to the coding process. By conducting thorough testing, bugs and issues were identified and resolved quickly. Emphasis was placed on writing clean and well-documented code and complying with coding standards and best practices.

## Testing and Importance
Testing played a crucial role in ensuring the functionality and stability of the app. I can't count how many logs I had to use to debug and test different aspects of the codebase throughout development.

Testing is essential because it identifies problems and helps fix them, guaranteeing a seamless and error-free user experience. Additionally, it guarantees faith in the app's dependability and effectiveness, boosting user happiness and confidence.

## Innovation and Challenges
Throughout the app design and development process, innovation was necessary to overcome challenges. One significant challenge was implementing the goal tracking and notification feature accurately. Innovative solutions were used to track users' progress toward their goal weight and trigger notifications once hit.

## Demonstrating Knowledge and Skills
The Weight Tracker app's implementation demonstrates knowledge, expertise, and experience in a number of areas. Particularly noteworthy are the database administration, user authentication, and notification systems that show mastery in data processing, safe user access, and efficient use of platform-specific capabilities. Usability and aesthetics are taken into account in UI design and navigation flow.

Overall, the process of creating the Weight Tracker app involved many different facets of app design, coding, testing, and creativity, all of which helped make it functional and user-friendly.
